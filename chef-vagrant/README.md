This is an improvement upon "chef-repo", which requires all the manual steps to run chef-solo, 
including installing VM, chef-solo.
Please note how the solo.rb and web.json contents un "chef-repo" were transfered to VagrantFile entries.

Pre-requirement:
1. Vagrant.
2. VirtualBox.

Step:
vagrant up

Then you should have a working web server.
